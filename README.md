1\. Introduction
----------------



A hackathon is an event where participants collaborate intensively to develop innovative solutions to specific challenges. Unlike traditional hackathons that primarily focus on coding, business hackathons emphasize strategic thinking, creative problem-solving, and business model development. This guide aims to assist universities in successfully organizing both intra (within a single university) and inter-university (among multiple universities) business hackathons.

--------------

*   Foster Innovation: Encourage students to think creatively and develop novel business solutions.
