2\. Objectives
--------------

*   Foster Innovation: Encourage students to think creatively and develop novel business solutions.
    
*   Promote Collaboration: Facilitate interdisciplinary teamwork among students from various academic backgrounds.
    
*   Real-World Problem Solving: Provide students a platform to tackle business challenges.
    
*   Skill Development: Enhance participants' skills in strategic planning, market analysis, and business model formulation.
    
*   Networking Opportunities: Connect students with industry professionals, mentors, and potential investors.

### 7.3 Scoring Models

### 

A well-defined scoring model ensures consistency and transparency in evaluation. Different approaches can be used based on the hackathon's objectives.

*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** Some aspects, such as adherence to submission guidelines, may have a binary pass/fail system.
*   **Bonus Points:** Extra points for exceptional ideas, sustainability factors, or audience engagement.
